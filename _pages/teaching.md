During my postdoctoral experience, I taught courses in Population Genetics and Copy Number Timing as part of computational biology classes at:

- University of Trieste (UNITS) – Course material: [GDA GitHub](https://github.com/caravagn/GDA)
- ICTP Summer School – Course info: [ICTP event](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10865/overview)

These lectures cover mathematical modelling and practical implementation of Bayesian methods.
