I transitioned from theoretical physics after my PhD to translational, data-driven research, moved by the desire of applying mathematics to real-world problems. I have a strong passion for mathematical modeling, probabilistic inference, and extracting insight from complex data, particularly using Bayesian statistics, stochastic processes, and interpretable machine learning frameworks. I enjoy translating abstract quantitative models into actionable tools and insights.

A central aspect of my postdoctoral work has been bridging the gap between complex quantitative models and clinically meaningful interpretations, supporting hypothesis generation and decision-making. I applied my skills to biomedical and biological problems, working with bulk whole-genome sequencing, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and clinical data, turning high-dimensional datasets into structured, actionable insight.

I also contributed to the development of computational genomics tools and pipelines to streamline the analysis of complex datasets, and mentored Master’s and PhD students, guiding them in quantitative methods, model development, and reproducible research practices.

I am currently preparing several preprints for submission to peer-reviewed journals, highlighting both methodological rigor and translational significance. I am eager to leverage my interdisciplinary expertise in biotech, health-tech, or research-driven companies, thriving in collaborative environments that prioritize curiosity, innovation, and impactful research.
