We applied data analysis, mathematical modeling, and Bayesian inference to longitudinal whole-genome sequencing (WGS) AML samples to determine when HLA loss relapses occur after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Timing models revealed that most therapy-resistant clones arise post-transplant, and mutational signatures linked the antiviral drug Ganciclovir to these immune-escape events. This approach demonstrates how rigorous computational methods can translate genomic data into actionable clinical insights, identifying key factors driving post-transplant relapse.
