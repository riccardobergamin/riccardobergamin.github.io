We developed a population epigenetic (PEPI) framework that extends classical population genetics to include reversible epigenetic mutations which can drive tumor evolution. PEPI models integrate stochastic genetic accumulation with reversible epigenetic flip-flop switches, allowing us to derive population dynamics, site frequency spectra, and jump statistics. Bayesian inference applied to longitudinal cell-count and sequencing data enables learning of key evolutionary parameters. This approach translates rigorous mathematical modeling into insights on how reversible epi-mutations shape tumor populations, informing our understanding of cancer evolution.

The code and examples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/caravagnalab/PEPI).
